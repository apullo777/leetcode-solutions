# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [3,4,5]
# Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
